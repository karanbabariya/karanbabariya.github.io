#### My name is Karan Babariya!

I am a currently pursuing [Masters of Management Analytics](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/Degrees/MastersPrograms/MMA), 2020 at Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto. Prior to joining Rotman, I worked as a Senior Member Technical Staff (Full Stack Web Developer) at Mentor - A Siemens Business where I was a part of product development wing of Capital Suite, driven to provide solutions to automotive industry for designing wiring harnesses in vehicles.

Having realized the potential of analytics and its immense benefits to the industry I now carry deep interests for the field in my pockets. I am a huge fan of extracting stories out of data and in my spare time I enjoy solving data science challenges for subjects that matter. My interests lies in exploring new places and adventures, motorbiking and voluteering pet shelter.
