#### My name is Karan Babariya!

My first encounter with fear was in my school days where I happened to be one of the 92% of students who failed the Computer Programming in Java test. Little did I realise that this ‘fear-setting’ exercise would go on to become a ‘goal-setting’ one. I persevered, and started falling in love with the subject. I learned the joy of picking myself up after falling. Possessing the same drive, I overcame all my fears and came to Rotman to further my education.

I am a [Masters of Management Analytics](https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/Degrees/MastersPrograms/MMA), 2020 Rotman School of Management (University of Toronto) graduate. Prior to joining Rotman, I worked as a Senior Member Technical Staff (Full Stack Web Developer) at Mentor - A Siemens Business. As product development wing of Capital Suite, we were driven to provide solutions to automotive industry for designing wiring harnesses in vehicles. It was there where I was able to hone my computational skills and gain exposure to the remarkable field of Data Analytics.

Having realized the potential of analytics and its immense benefits to the industry, I now carry deep interests for the field in my pockets. I am a huge fan of extracting stories out of data and in my spare time I enjoy solving data science challenges. 
Further, my interests also lies in exploring new places and adventures, motorbiking and volunteering for pet shelter.
